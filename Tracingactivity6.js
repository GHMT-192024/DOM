// Imagine you're building a program to control a robot that
// manages a webpage displaying a menu for a restaurant. The
// robot needs to update the menu dynamically based on
// available dishes and customer preferences.

// How does this example relate to the previous example of
// modifying a nested list in terms of DOM manipulation and
// updating the webpage?
// What other actions could the robot perform on the webpage
// to manage the menu? (e.g., adding new sections, updating
// prices, highlighting special offers)
